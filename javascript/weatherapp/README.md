The following files make up the in-house JavaScript project taught to us by Mentors in the Timespro JavaScript sessions.

The project is a weather application that makes use of an api to provide weather details of a city that is entered in the search column.

The bare bones foundation of the project is laid out in HTML, the pages are styled using an external stylesheet & the user input is manipulated to give out the desired output using an external JavaScript file.
