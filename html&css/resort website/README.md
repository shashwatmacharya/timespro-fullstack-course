Files in the folder are consistent of the In-house project built with the teaching of mentors from Timespro's HTML &CSSS classes.

There exist Assets in the form of stylesheets in the "styles" folder and the corresponding images in the "images" folder.

The project is an attempt at replicating the Club Mahindra Assonara Goa website. The basic Skeletal foundations are laid out in HTML and all the web pages are styles using the stylesheets. 

Regarding the current status of this project, it is not currently active. This was the first project built with Timespro, since then there has been a lot of folder-arranging and file-displacement which has caused errors within the project files themselves, i am working diligently to bring the project back up.
