The following project is built by me using all the tools & techniques taught to me by mentors in the Timespro JavaScript Sessions and serves as my JavaScript project.

The project is a Dgital clock built in Javascript using only the date function.

HTML file is used to display the clock and an external stylesheet is used to provide basic styling to the clock.

The project serves as a good utility or a tool to add on to other JavaScript projects in the future.
